Welcome to Agrifood Research Methods.

Course co-ordinator: Dr Ian Hunt, TIA

This course is about modern statistics and old-fashioned critical thinking.  Informally, if you complete the course then this is what you will be able to do:

1. Be realistic, but optimistic, about using statistics and probability reasoning.       
2. Use a computer to properly analyse scientific data (which entails going beyond Microsoft Excel).
3. Make justifiable and reproducible statistical inferences using real data.
4. Plan for the coherent analysis of data in your future agrifood studies, careers and life.  

Please have a computer with R and RStudio (Desktop) installed. RStudio is open source software and can be downloaded from:
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. Instructions for installing R (immediately before RStudio) are at the same site.
