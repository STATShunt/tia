Welcome to Agrifood Research Methods.

Course co-ordinator: Dr Ian Hunt, TIA

This course is about modern statistics and old-fashioned critical thinking.  Informally, if you complete the course then this is what you will be able to do:

1. Be realistic, but optimistic, about using statistics and probability reasoning.       
2. Use a computer to properly analyse scientific data (which entails going beyond Microsoft Excel).
3. Make justifiable and reproducible statistical inferences using real data.
4. Plan for the coherent analysis of data in your future agrifood studies, careers and life.  

Please have a computer with R and RStudio (Desktop) installed before the first session starts. RStudio is open source software and can be downloaded from:
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. Instructions for installing R (immediately before RStudio) are at the same site.

RESOURCES: The notes in the folder above are DRAFT at this stage - I will be making a few changes as we proceed.  As we need them, further folders with computing resources, including data and R scripts, will be added.

ZOOM: All online sessions will be at https://utas.zoom.us/j/89795424322
