"The ""treatment"" column identifies the waterlogged plants (wl) or normal ""control"" conditions (con).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Multiple varieties are planted across 4 ""reps"" in each condition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Varieties with a ""+"" symbol are bred to be tolerent to waterlogging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yield and RCA are the most important outcomes (RCA is root aerenchyma, which is when roots develop ""straws"" to access oxygen under waterlogging conditions).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
