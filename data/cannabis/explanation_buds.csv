Data are from a pot trial in a greenhouse (each row is a plant).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All plants are cuttings from the same parent (soil is the same in each pot and position in greenhouse is randomised).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The ""Sample"" column identifies each plant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The ""treatment"" column identifies the level of nitrogen and stress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Treatments 1 to 4 increase nitrogen and have no stress.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Treatments 5 and 6 are stressed with the same nitrogen as 3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Weight is biomass on harvesting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Main output of interest is CBDA, which is the percentage of biomass that is the chemical of interest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
