All plants are sunflowers from the same seed packet (soil is the same in each pot and position in blocks is randomised).,,,,,,
"The ""block"" column identifies the broad position in the greenhouse.",,,,,,
"The ""product"" column identifies the size of the crushed urchin dust (1=coarse, 2=medium, 3=fine)",,,,,,
"The ""rate"" column identifies the ppm for fertiliser (RATE1 to RATE5 is crushed urchin, with RATE1 being the lowest ppm)",,,,,,
RATE0 is not urchin fertiliser but an industry standard mix.,,,,,,
"The ""plant"" column is a redundant pot ID.",,,,,,
The period is the last measurement week.,,,,,,
height and csa are outcome measurements.,,,,,,
