# the following code is indicative of what you need to do
# do not "cut and paste", rather, "run the code and think".
# then alter code carefully to answer the challenge's questions

###  CHALLENGE 10
###################################################

### question 1 
# use the same code as Challenge 9, changing the required function inputs


### question 2
# you have this code from Challenge 9

### question 3
# essentially the same as Challenge 9 (note proportion not total)

### question 4
# see Challenge 9 and your answers to Q5 there 

### question 5
# be brief and just try to demonstrate to me what is going on
